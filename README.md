### About the Project.

Welcome to my Capstone Project for the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp I completed in December 2021.  The goal of this project was to see if it is possible to use weather data to predict daily lift openings at WhistlerBlackcomb throughout the ski seasons.  The initial project planned on prediciting all lifts, but has been narrowed down to focus on the Peak chair on Whistler only.

### Getting Started

The entire projet was completed in Jupyter Notebooks.  Please see the official [Jupyter Install guide](https://jupyter.org/install) for setup instructions if required.  Libraries you will require include:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.4.3/users/installing.html)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

Notebook 03 only has two plots using plotly express.  They are not critical to understanding the project but if you would like to view them you will also need to install [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/).

Alternatively, if you are already running anaconda, you can use the liftprediction-env.txt file in the main repository to build the required environment using `conda env create --file liftprediction-env.txt`.

All of the cleaned data is provided in the Data folder.  Be sure to download this if you want to run any of the code in notebooks 05 or 06.  This is where all the interesting analysis and modelling occured.

### Acknowledgements

Much thanks must be given to a number of people who contributed in various ways to this project.  First and foremost, Dr. Douw Steyn for all of his advice on weather data specifics and general encouragement, Mr. David Jones for pointing me to the weather balloon data sets and all the details around WhistlerBlackcombâ€™s weather data collection, Mr. Todd Laney for providing me with his PowDay push notification database, Dr. Pascal Haegeli for connecting me to David Jones and steering me away from irrelevant avalanche forecast data, and last but not least, the whole BrainStation Data Science Education Team for all their advice and direction.  My thanks to each and every one of you for your support through this project.
